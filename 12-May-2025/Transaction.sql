--TRANSACTION 1
COMMIT;

/* Ans: Serializable is the one that completely prevents phantom because it blocks the concurrent access and even
tracks the part of the state involved in the transaction therefore it can prevent both the read
and write phantoms*/

/* 6) Can Postgres perform a dirty read (reading uncommitted data from another transaction)? */

/* Ans: No Postgres doesn't allows to perform dirty reads. A dirty read occurs when Transaction B reads data that was modified by Transaction A but not yet committed. 
If Transaction A rolls back, Transaction B has read invalid, therefore it leads to incosistent data.
postgres enforces  MVCC(Multi-Version Concurrency Control) which doesn't allows the read uncommitted level
by default, it enforces read committed by defalut other levels such as repeatable reads and serializable is
supported by postgres.Therefore PostgreSQL always protects you from dirty reads. */

/* 7) If autocommit is ON (default in Postgres), and I execute an UPDATE, is it safe to assume the change is immediately committed? */

/*ans: Autocommit is the mode that treats every single statement as individual transactions,until
it is explicility defined inside the begin and commit block, which is the explicit way of the creating
transaction.Therefore any statement that is not explicitly defined is a transaction and it will be
committed immediately after execution. */

--TRANSACTION 2
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;


/*Ans: No, The second transaction won't see the updated balances because by default postgres
enforces read committed level , so only the committed changes are visible in other transactions.
Here changes made in the transaction 1 is not committed , so these changes are not visible in
second transaction. */
